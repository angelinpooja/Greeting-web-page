Greeting Web Page
Overview:
This is a simple and interactive web page that allows users to enter their name and receive a personalized greeting. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the design is clean, responsive, and easy to use. 
The greeting message toggles on and off with a button click, making it a lightweight and user-friendly front-end project.

Features:
User-friendly form for entering names
Toggle button to show/hide a personalized greeting
Smooth transitions and modern card layout
Responsive design that works across devices
Clear error handling for empty input fields

Technologies Used:
HTML5 – Structure and layout
CSS3 – Styling and transitions
JavaScript – Dynamic interactions and logic

How It Works:
User enters their name in the input field.

On clicking the "Greet" button:
If the field is empty, an alert prompts the user to enter their name.
If a name is entered, a personalized greeting is displayed.
Clicking the button again hides the message.
